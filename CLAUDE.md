This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python desktop application called "DJs Timeline-maskin" (DJs Timeline Machine). It is designed to help investigative journalists and researchers to quickly renaming pdf files and/or create timelines i excel. The first part of the app processes PDF files extracts different parts of the filename. User can then edit these parts and rename the file. It is also possible to copy the old or new file name to the second part of the app: The excel integration. Here the user can add information to a number of fields. By cklicking a button user can then both rename the pdf-file and add a row to a selected excel-document. 
A third way to use the app is by manually add content to excel-fields and create a new excel row without any pdf file selected or renamed. This is practical for researchers whon for example is picking information from books or other sources. 
The application has been refactored from a single large file into a modular structure.

## Current Status (v2.3.3)

**Custom Field Names Display Bug Fix (v2.3.3)**:
- âœ… FIXED critical bug where custom field names were saved but not displayed in main UI
- **Root Cause**: `_on_field_config_applied()` method deleted entire config file immediately after custom names were saved
- **Solution**: Removed config deletion, changed to selective user data clearing only
- **Result**: Custom field names now persist correctly and display immediately after Apply
- **Debug Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging throughout custom field name data flow

**Custom Field Naming Feature Implementation (v2.3.0)**:
- Successfully implemented comprehensive custom field naming system with 100% functionality
- Created field identity system separating internal IDs from user-configurable display names
- Developed professional 900x700 configuration dialog with real-time validation and visual feedback
- Enhanced configuration management with custom field names storage and migration
- Updated Excel integration to use dynamic field names instead of hardcoded columns
- Implemented complete data reset and UI redraw mechanism when field names change

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **Field Identity System**: Clean separation between internal field IDs (`startdatum`, `starttid`) and display names ("Startdatum", "Starttid") 
- **Validation Framework**: Max 13 chars, no spaces, no duplicates with Swedish error messages
- **Professional Dialog**: Two-column layout with protected vs renamable fields, real-time feedback
- **Complete Reset Mechanism**: Warning dialogs, data clearing, configuration reset, UI redraw
- **Excel Integration**: Dynamic column headers using `field_manager.get_all_display_names()`

**Technical Implementation**:
- `core/field_definitions.py`: Field identity system with FieldDefinitionManager class
- `core/field_validator.py`: Comprehensive validation with real-time feedback
- `gui/field_config_dialog.py`: 610-line professional configuration interface
- Enhanced: `core/config.py`, `core/excel_manager.py`, `gui/main_window.py`, `gui/layout_manager.py`
- Updated: Tools menu with "Konfigurera fÃ¤lt..." option

**Time Field Validation UX Fix (v2.2.15)**:
- Fixed critical UX issue where time fields trapped users with validation errors on focus loss
- Made time field behavior consistent with date fields (placeholder text restoration, no forced validation)
- Removed aggressive FocusOut validation binding from time fields while maintaining data integrity during save operations
- Used bug-finder-debugger agent for systematic root cause analysis and precise fix implementation
- Solution: Removed `entry.bind('<FocusOut>', lambda e, field=col_name: self.parent.validate_time_field(e, field))` from excel_fields.py:650

**Font Size Field Stability Fix (v2.2.13)**:
- Fixed critical issue where Note1-3 fields were growing when changing font size
- Added grid weight constraints to Note fields matching HÃ¤ndelse field behavior
- Now only text size changes while field dimensions remain stable across all font sizes (9pt, 12pt, 15pt)
- Solution: Added `grid_rowconfigure(row+2, weight=1)` to Note1, Note2, Note3 fields in excel_fields.py

**Space Optimization & Session Persistence Achievement (v2.2.7-v2.2.11)**:
- Successfully optimized GUI for maximum space efficiency on lower resolution screens
- Eliminated unnecessary padding and decorative elements while maintaining functionality
- Implemented inline character counters saving ~4 rows of vertical space
- Added auto-disappearing placeholder text for improved user guidance (YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM)
- Created clear visual hierarchy with prominent action buttons using color coding
- Fixed session persistence issues: color button states and column width memory

**Major UI/UX Improvements (v2.2.7-v2.2.11)**:
- **Orange copy button**: "â†“ Kopiera ned filnamnet till ExcelfÃ¤ltet â†“" with arrows and distinctive color for clear workflow indication
- **Enlarged operation buttons**: Save/Reset buttons made 200x40/180x40 pixels for better prominence
- **Reorganized operations area**: Color selection and buttons in separate light grey containers under HÃ¤ndelse field
- **Compact statistics**: Changed from "PDF:er Ã¶ppnade: X" to "PDF: X" format with smaller font
- **Visual separation**: Different background colors between sections (gray90, gray88, gray86) for better organization
- **Removed obsolete elements**: Theme menu removed (not applicable to CustomTkinter)

**Session Persistence Features (v2.2.11)**:
- **Column width memory**: Excel column sash positions saved to config and restored on startup
- **Color button state consistency**: Visual selection state properly resets after save operations
- **Proportional scaling**: Saved column positions adapt to different screen sizes automatically
- **Smart fallbacks**: New users get sensible 40/30/30 defaults, existing users keep preferences

**Comprehensive Testing Implementation (v2.2.3)**:
- Successfully implemented complete test suite with 120 tests total
- Phase 1: 115 autonomous unit tests covering core business logic (filename_parser, pdf_processor, excel_manager, config)
- Phase 2: 5 semi-autonomous integration tests covering complete user workflows
- Tests achieve 96% autonomous coverage with 4% requiring user verification
- Created TESTING_GUIDE.md with comprehensive documentation for future development workflow
- All tests pass and provide robust foundation for safe refactoring and feature development

**Major Architectural Achievement (v2.2.2)**:
- Successfully modularized main_window.py from 35,000+ tokens into 7 specialized mixin modules
- Achieved exceptional code organization with clean separation of concerns
- Created PDFOperationsMixin, ExcelOperationsMixin, LayoutManagerMixin, EventHandlersMixin, UndoManagerMixin, FormattingManagerMixin, and StatsManagerMixin
- Main window reduced from ~3000 lines to 384 lines with identical functionality
- Excel hybrid operations preserved exactly without any modifications
- All functionality tested and verified working perfectly

**Key Technical Solutions**:
- **Space optimization**: Inline counters, reduced padding, compact labels
- **Placeholder text**: Manual Entry-StringVar binding to preserve CustomTkinter placeholder functionality
- **Session persistence**: Config-based saving/restoration of UI state (sash positions, color states)
- **Visual hierarchy**: Color-coded buttons (orange=transfer, green=save, blue=reset) for clear workflow
- **Modular architecture**: Clean mixin inheritance with no circular dependencies

**Testing Notes**:
- Comprehensive test suite available: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Always run Ruff syntax check before committing: `ruff check . --fix`
- Run integration tests before releases: `python -m pytest tests/test_integration_workflows.py -v -s`
- See TESTING_GUIDE.md for complete testing workflow procedures
- Test application startup after layout changes
- Critical: Always test placeholder text visibility and session persistence features

## Additional guideline on github commit
**Never* mention yourself (Claude) in comment when doing commit. *Never* write stuff like "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>". 

## Working Principles

- **Honest Collaboration Guideline**: 
  * Prioritize technical accuracy. Point out bugs, inefficiencies, and better approaches immediately. 
  * Confirm understanding with minimal acknowledgment. Focus on code quality, performance, and maintainability. 
  * Challenge bad ideas with specific alternatives.

- **UX Validation & Bug Investigation Approach** (learned in v2.2.15):
  * Use specialized sub-agents (bug-finder-debugger) for systematic investigation of behavioral issues
  * Always compare working vs non-working patterns to identify root cause differences
  * Focus on user experience consistency - fields of same type should behave identically
  * Distinguish between data validation (necessary) and UX validation (can be overly aggressive)
  * Document specific code locations and event bindings when investigating GUI behavior issues
  * Test behavioral changes thoroughly to ensure consistent UX across similar UI elements

- **Systematic Feature Implementation Approach** (learned in v2.3.0):
  * Use complete rewrite architecture with GitHub fallback safety for major features
  * Separate identity systems (internal IDs vs display names) for flexibility and maintainability  
  * Create comprehensive validation frameworks with real-time feedback and visual indicators
  * Design professional configuration interfaces with clear protected/modifiable sections
  * Implement complete reset mechanisms with warning dialogs for data-destructive operations
  * Always identify and document any remaining bugs with specific fix plans for next session
  * Use specialized sub-agents (architecture-planner, code-writer) for systematic implementation phases

- **Critical Bug Investigation Methodology** (learned in v2.3.3):
  * Use multiple specialized subagents (bug-finder-debugger, architecture-planner) for systematic root cause analysis
  * Trace complete data flow from save â†’ storage â†’ reload â†’ display to identify exact failure points
  * Add comprehensive debug logging at every critical data transition point
  * Verify fixes work for all edge cases (first-time users, existing users, config deletion scenarios)
  * Never assume initial analysis is correct - use systematic investigation to verify root cause
  * Document exact sequence of events leading to failure for future reference
