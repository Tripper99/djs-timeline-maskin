# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python desktop application called "DJs Timeline-maskin" (DJs Timeline Machine). It is designed to help investigative journalists and researchers to quickly renaming pdf files and/or create timelines i excel. The first part of the app processes PDF files extracts different parts of the filename. User can then edit these parts and rename the file. It is also possible to copy the old or new file name to the second part of the app: The excel integration. Here the user can add information to a number of fields. By cklicking a button user can then both rename the pdf-file and add a row to a selected excel-document. 
A third way to use the app is by manually add content to excel-fields and create a new excel row without any pdf file selected or renamed. This is practical for researchers whon for example is picking information from books or other sources. 
The application has been refactored from a single large file into a modular structure.

## Current Status (v2.5.1)

**Latest Achievement (v2.5.1)**: Field hiding functionality now works consistently across all Excel operations. Hidden fields marked as "DÃ¶lj" are properly excluded from Excel template creation.

**Key Features**:
- Template management system with field hiding capability
- Custom field naming with professional configuration dialog  
- Modular architecture with 7 specialized mixin modules
- Comprehensive test suite (120 tests)
- Session persistence and space-optimized UI
- Swedish localization throughout

**Architecture Status**:
- Clean modular design with main_window.py reduced from 35,000+ tokens to 384 lines
- Field identity system with separation between internal IDs and display names
- Professional configuration dialogs with real-time validation
- Excel integration respects field visibility consistently

**Testing Framework**:
- Comprehensive test suite available: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Always run Ruff syntax check before committing: `ruff check . --fix`
- Integration tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_integration_workflows.py -v -s`
- See TESTING_GUIDE.md for complete workflow procedures

## Documentation Management Guidelines

**CLAUDE.md Content Strategy**:
- Keep CLAUDE.md focused on current status and working principles only
- Include only the very latest development achievement (current version) in Current Status section
- Remove older development history when adding new entries to prevent document growth
- For detailed development history, technical analysis, and version milestones â†’ use `docs\DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`
- Always reference DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md for comprehensive historical details
- Maintain clean, actionable guidance rather than extensive historical records

**Development History Documentation**:
- Comprehensive technical details, root cause analyses, and implementation insights go in `docs\DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`
- Each major version should have detailed entry with problem/solution/technical excellence documentation
- Include investigation methodology, sub-agent usage, and development process insights
- Preserve valuable technical knowledge for future development sessions

## Additional guideline on github commit
**Never* mention yourself (Claude) in comment when doing commit. *Never* write stuff like "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>". 

## Working Principles

- **Honest Collaboration Guideline**: 
  * Prioritize technical accuracy. Point out bugs, inefficiencies, and better approaches immediately. 
  * Confirm understanding with minimal acknowledgment. Focus on code quality, performance, and maintainability. 
  * Challenge bad ideas with specific alternatives.

- **UX Validation & Bug Investigation Approach** (learned in v2.2.15):
  * Use specialized sub-agents (bug-finder-debugger) for systematic investigation of behavioral issues
  * Always compare working vs non-working patterns to identify root cause differences
  * Focus on user experience consistency - fields of same type should behave identically
  * Distinguish between data validation (necessary) and UX validation (can be overly aggressive)
  * Document specific code locations and event bindings when investigating GUI behavior issues
  * Test behavioral changes thoroughly to ensure consistent UX across similar UI elements

- **Systematic Feature Implementation Approach** (learned in v2.3.0):
  * Use complete rewrite architecture with GitHub fallback safety for major features
  * Separate identity systems (internal IDs vs display names) for flexibility and maintainability  
  * Create comprehensive validation frameworks with real-time feedback and visual indicators
  * Design professional configuration interfaces with clear protected/modifiable sections
  * Implement complete reset mechanisms with warning dialogs for data-destructive operations
  * Always identify and document any remaining bugs with specific fix plans for next session
  * Use specialized sub-agents (architecture-planner, code-writer) for systematic implementation phases

- **Critical Bug Investigation Methodology** (learned in v2.3.3 & v2.5.1):
  * Use multiple specialized subagents (bug-finder-debugger, architecture-planner, code-reviewer-refactorer) for systematic root cause analysis
  * Trace complete data flow from configuration â†’ storage â†’ usage to identify exact failure points
  * Search for architectural inconsistencies - look for pattern violations (e.g., 9 methods use correct approach, 1 uses wrong approach)
  * Add comprehensive debug logging at every critical data transition point
  * Verify fixes work for all edge cases and don't cause regression in existing functionality
  * Use systematic investigation with sub-agents rather than assumptions - they often reveal deeper architectural insights
  * Document exact sequence of events and technical solutions for future reference

- **mandatory git commit routine**
  * Before writing code you should always make a new version and commit it to git with comments on what you are about to do. 
  * After making changes the user must get an oportunity to do testruns. 
  * If and when user says that changes works, you should do a new commit, with comments reflecting the successful code change. 
  * Never write comments about successful revisions unless the user has done test runs.
