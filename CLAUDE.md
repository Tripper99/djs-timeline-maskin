# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python desktop application called "DJs Timeline-maskin" (DJs Timeline Machine). It is designed to help investigative journalists and researchers to quickly renaming pdf files and/or create timelines i excel. The first part of the app processes PDF files extracts different parts of the filename. User can then edit these parts and rename the file. It is also possible to copy the old or new file name to the second part of the app: The excel integration. Here the user can add information to a number of fields. By cklicking a button user can then both rename the pdf-file and add a row to a selected excel-document. 
A third way to use the app is by manually add content to excel-fields and create a new excel row without any pdf file selected or renamed. This is practical for researchers whon for example is picking information from books or other sources. 
The application has been refactored from a single large file into a modular structure.

```

### Core Classes

- **PDFProcessorApp** (gui/main_window.py): Main GUI application class - handles all GUI layout and user interaction
- **DialogManager** (gui/dialogs.py): Dialog management and user interactions
- **ExcelFieldManager** (gui/excel_fields.py): Excel field creation and layout management
- **PDFProcessor** (core/pdf_processor.py): PDF file operations and validation
- **FilenameParser** (core/filename_parser.py): Filename parsing and text cleaning
- **ExcelManager** (core/excel_manager.py): Excel file operations and formatting
- **ConfigManager** (core/config.py): Application configuration persistence
- **ToolTip, ScrollableText, ScrollableFrame** (gui/utils.py): GUI utilities including tooltips, scrollable text widgets, and full-window scrolling

## Key Features

1. **PDF Processing**: Extract text from PDF files using PyPDF2
2. **Filename Generation**: Parse PDF content to generate structured filenames
3. **Excel Integration**: Update Excel spreadsheets with extracted information
4. **Configuration Management**: Save/load user preferences and settings
5. **Modern GUI**: Built with ttkbootstrap for modern appearance

## Configuration

The application uses JSON configuration stored in `pdf_processor_config.json` with:
- **Excel file path** - Path to selected Excel file
- **Last PDF directory** - Last used PDF directory for file dialog
- **Window geometry** - Window size and position
- **Theme settings** - ttkbootstrap theme selection
- **Locked field configurations** - Which fields are locked (true/false)
- **Locked field contents** - Plain text content of locked fields
- **Locked field formats** *(v1.14.0)* - Rich text formatting data for locked fields

### Configuration Structure (v1.14.0)
```json
{
  "excel_file": "path/to/excel/file.xlsx",
  "window_geometry": "2560x1320+-112+21",
  "theme": "simplex",
  "locked_fields": {
    "Note1": true,
    "H√§ndelse": false
  },
  "locked_field_contents": {
    "Note1": "Plain text content"
  },
  "locked_field_formats": {
    "Note1": [
      {
        "tag": "bold",
        "start": "1.0", 
        "end": "1.15"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Backward Compatibility**: Configuration files from previous versions work seamlessly. Missing `locked_field_formats` section is treated as empty formatting.

## Excel hybrid methods
v1.7.4 contains the COMPLETE WORKING Excel hybrid method. 
These methods solved persistant problems that the app had with writing corrextly formatted text to excel cells. 
The breakthrough hybrid approach consista of:
- openpyxl for reading existing Excel data (preserves formulas)  
- xlsxwriter for writing new data (handles rich text perfectly)
- Method 2 character-by-character algorithm for text extraction
This method might seem complicated but is important to understand that this is the only way we've found to make the app to write perfect Excel rich text formatting with colors, bold, italic, line breaks.

## Current Status (v1.17.14)

**COMPLETED ‚úÖ - RICH TEXT BACKGROUND COLOR FIX**: Successfully resolved xlsxwriter write_rich_string() limitation

### Working Features (v1.17.14):
- ‚úÖ **Rich Text Background Colors**: All text fields (including rich text) support background colors correctly ‚úÖ FIXED!

### Rich Text Format Preservation (v1.14.0)
**NEW SYSTEM**: Complete format preservation for locked text fields across app sessions

**Text Fields with Format Preservation**: Note1, Note2, Note3, H√§ndelse
**Supported Formatting**: Bold, Italic, Colors (Red, Blue, Green, Default)
**Format Storage**: JSON-compatible tag ranges in configuration file
**Usage**: Apply formatting ‚Üí Lock field ‚Üí Formatting preserved across sessions

## Known Issues

### Rich Text Background Colors (v1.17.9-v1.17.14) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- **Status**: All text fields including rich text now support background colors ‚úÖ FIXED!
- **Root Cause**: `xlsxwriter.write_rich_string()` required format parameter + existing rows lost color detection
- **Investigation**: Two-phase fix - correct API usage (v1.17.13) + color preservation (v1.17.14)
- **Final Solution**: Correct xlsxwriter API + `_extract_row_color_from_format()` method for existing rows
- **Result**: Perfect background color support across all field types with full formatting preservation

### Rich Text Uniform Formatting Bug (Excel Export) - SEPARATE ISSUE
- **Status**: Affects Excel output only, GUI works perfectly
- **Issue**: Text with uniform formatting (all red, all bold) disappears in Excel
- **Location**: `core/excel_manager.py` xlsxwriter rich text API handling  
- **Workaround**: Use mixed formatting within text

### Window Height on External Monitors
- ‚úÖ **Laptop screens**: Full functionality, all elements visible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **External monitors**: Slightly shortened window (800px max) but fully functional
- **Impact**: Minimal - all features accessible, status bar visible

## Modular Refactoring - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Dialog Extraction (v1.9.3) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Created `gui/dialogs.py` with `DialogManager` class
- Extracted 4 dialog methods (~540 lines from main_window.py)
- Application tested and working perfectly

### Phase 2: Excel Field Management (v1.9.5) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- Created `gui/excel_fields.py` with `ExcelFieldManager` class
- Extracted 6 Excel field methods (~400-500 lines from main_window.py)
- Perfect 3-column layout preserved with all functionality

## Important Development Rules
- **Never edit** `APP DJs Timeline-verktyg v170 FUNKAR.py` - old single-file version (backup)
- **Always use** `app.py` as the starting point for the refactored modular version
- **Never** try to change the Excel hybrid methods without asking the user - v1.7.4 contains the only working solution
- **Preserve working code**: When refactoring, extract code exactly as-is, don't "improve" during extraction
- **Test immediately**: After any structural changes, test the application thoroughly
- **Grid layout is sacred**: The three-column Excel fields layout uses grid with `uniform="col"` - never change this

## Development Notes

- All GUI components are built using ttkbootstrap
- Logging is configured for debugging
- No automated tests are present in the codebase
- No build process required - runs directly with Python interpreter
- **Current version**: v1.17.8 (stable master with enhanced formatting toolbar design)
- **Last tested**: 2025-07-29 - All v1.17.8 improvements verified working
