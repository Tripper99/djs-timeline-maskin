# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python desktop application called "DJs Timeline-maskin" (DJs Timeline Machine). It is designed to help investigative journalists and researchers to quickly renaming pdf files and/or create timelines i excel. The first part of the app processes PDF files extracts different parts of the filename. User can then edit these parts and rename the file. It is also possible to copy the old or new file name to the second part of the app: The excel integration. Here the user can add information to a number of fields. By cklicking a button user can then both rename the pdf-file and add a row to a selected excel-document. 
A third way to use the app is by manually add content to excel-fields and create a new excel row without any pdf file selected or renamed. This is practical for researchers whon for example is picking information from books or other sources. 
The application has been refactored from a single large file into a modular structure.

```

### Core Classes

- **PDFProcessorApp** (gui/main_window.py): Main GUI application class - handles all GUI layout and user interaction
- **DialogManager** (gui/dialogs.py): Dialog management and user interactions
- **ExcelFieldManager** (gui/excel_fields.py): Excel field creation and layout management
- **PDFProcessor** (core/pdf_processor.py): PDF file operations and validation
- **FilenameParser** (core/filename_parser.py): Filename parsing and text cleaning
- **ExcelManager** (core/excel_manager.py): Excel file operations and formatting
- **ConfigManager** (core/config.py): Application configuration persistence
- **ToolTip, ScrollableText, ScrollableFrame** (gui/utils.py): GUI utilities including tooltips, scrollable text widgets, and full-window scrolling

## Key Features

1. **PDF Processing**: Extract text from PDF files using PyPDF2
2. **Filename Generation**: Parse PDF content to generate structured filenames
3. **Excel Integration**: Update Excel spreadsheets with extracted information
4. **Configuration Management**: Save/load user preferences and settings
5. **Modern GUI**: Built with ttkbootstrap for modern appearance

## Configuration

The application uses JSON configuration stored in `pdf_processor_config.json` with:
- **Excel file path** - Path to selected Excel file
- **Last PDF directory** - Last used PDF directory for file dialog
- **Window geometry** - Window size and position
- **Theme settings** - ttkbootstrap theme selection
- **Locked field configurations** - Which fields are locked (true/false)
- **Locked field contents** - Plain text content of locked fields
- **Locked field formats** *(v1.14.0)* - Rich text formatting data for locked fields

### Configuration Structure (v1.14.0)
```json
{
  "excel_file": "path/to/excel/file.xlsx",
  "window_geometry": "2560x1320+-112+21",
  "theme": "simplex",
  "locked_fields": {
    "Note1": true,
    "Händelse": false
  },
  "locked_field_contents": {
    "Note1": "Plain text content"
  },
  "locked_field_formats": {
    "Note1": [
      {
        "tag": "bold",
        "start": "1.0", 
        "end": "1.15"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Backward Compatibility**: Configuration files from previous versions work seamlessly. Missing `locked_field_formats` section is treated as empty formatting.

## Refactoring Status

- ✅ **v1.9.5**: Completed Phase 2 refactoring - extracted ExcelFieldManager with layout fix

## Excel hybrid methods
v1.7.4 contains the COMPLETE WORKING Excel hybrid method. 
These methods solved persistant problems that the app had with writing corrextly formatted text to excel cells. 
The breakthrough hybrid approach consista of:
- openpyxl for reading existing Excel data (preserves formulas)  
- xlsxwriter for writing new data (handles rich text perfectly)
- Method 2 character-by-character algorithm for text extraction
This method might seem complicated but is important to understand that this is the only way we've found to make the app to write perfect Excel rich text formatting with colors, bold, italic, line breaks. 

## Rich Text Format Preservation (v1.14.0)
**NEW SYSTEM**: Complete format preservation for locked text fields across app sessions

### Text Fields with Format Preservation
The following 4 text fields support rich text formatting and preservation:
- **Note1** - Research notes with formatting
- **Note2** - Additional notes with formatting  
- **Note3** - Supplementary notes with formatting
- **Händelse** - Event description with formatting

### Supported Formatting
- **Bold** - Applied via toolbar "B" button
- **Italic** - Applied via toolbar "I" button
- **Colors** - Applied via toolbar color buttons:
  - **Red** (R button)
  - **Blue** (B button) 
  - **Green** (G button)
  - **Black** (K button)

### Format Storage System
Rich text formatting is stored as JSON-compatible tag ranges in the configuration file:
```json
"locked_field_formats": {
  "Note1": [
    {
      "tag": "bold",
      "start": "1.0",
      "end": "1.25"
    },
    {
      "tag": "red", 
      "start": "2.0",
      "end": "2.50"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Tag Serialization**: `serialize_text_widget_formatting()` scans tkinter Text widgets for formatting tags
- **Position Storage**: Tag ranges stored as tkinter index positions (line.character format)
- **Format Restoration**: `restore_text_widget_formatting()` reapplies tags on app startup
- **Selective Processing**: Only locked fields with formatting are serialized
- **Error Handling**: Invalid tag positions are safely ignored during restoration

### Usage Workflow
1. Apply formatting to text using toolbar buttons
2. Lock the field using the lock switch
3. Close the app (formatting automatically saved)
4. Restart the app (formatting automatically restored)

## Current Status (v1.17.3)

**SESSION-ONLY LOCK AND FOLDER OPENING**: Optimal balance between convenience and safety

### v1.17.3 Success (2025-07-29) - Session-Only Lock and Folder Opening Functionality ✅
**Achievement**: Implemented optimal user experience balance with session-only lock behavior and folder opening capability

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Session-Only Lock Behavior**: Output folder lock switch always starts unlocked on app startup
- ✅ **Persistent Folder Path**: Folder selection is remembered between sessions for user convenience  
- ✅ **New "Öppna mapp" Button**: Opens selected output folder in file explorer
- ✅ **Optimal UX Balance**: Safety (predictable lock behavior) + Convenience (remembered folder path)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modified `load_saved_output_folder()` to always initialize lock switch as False
- Updated config saving methods to not persist lock state (session-only behavior)
- Added `open_output_folder()` method with cross-platform file explorer support
- Enhanced GUI layout with new button positioned between lock switch and reset button

**User Benefits**:
- **Predictable Behavior**: Lock always starts unlocked, preventing unexpected auto-update blocking
- **Time Saving**: Previously selected folder remembered across sessions
- **Easy Access**: One-click folder opening in file explorer
- **Consistent Experience**: Lock behavior is session-only while folder path persists

**Design Decision**: This approach provides the best balance - folder path persistence saves user time while session-only lock ensures predictable behavior when selecting new PDFs.

### v1.17.1 Success (2025-07-29) - Output Folder UI and Behavior Improvements ✅
**Achievement**: Refined the output folder selection system with better layout, user-friendly display, and improved behavior

**UI Improvements**:
- ✅ **Compact Layout**: Moved "Nollställ mapp" button to same row as lock switch
- ✅ **User-Friendly Display**: Shows "Samma mapp som pdf-filen" instead of long file paths when folder matches PDF's parent directory
- ✅ **Smart Validation**: Prevents enabling lock switch when output folder is empty with clear error message

**Behavior Improvements**:
- ✅ **Always Update When Unlocked**: PDF selection now ALWAYS updates output folder when lock is off (removed empty folder restriction)
- ✅ **Consistent Experience**: Lock switch is the only control that prevents folder updates
- ✅ **Clear Error Messages**: User guidance when trying to lock empty folder selection

**Technical Enhancements**:
- Internal storage system separates actual paths from display text
- Enhanced validation and user feedback
- Improved folder path handling throughout the application

### v1.17.0 Success (2025-07-29) - Output Folder Selection System ✅
**Achievement**: Replaced the fixed "Omdöpta filer" subfolder switch with a comprehensive output folder selection system

**New Features**:
- ✅ **Output Folder Selection**: Choose any folder for renamed PDFs
- ✅ **Auto-fill Logic**: Automatically fills with PDF's directory when unlocked
- ✅ **Lock Switch**: Prevent folder from changing when selecting new PDFs
- ✅ **Reset Button**: "Nollställ mapp" clears selection and unlocks auto-update
- ✅ **Persistent Settings**: Output folder and lock state saved between sessions

**Layout Changes**:
- Removed: "Flytta omdöpt PDF till undermapp 'Omdöpta filer'" switch from Group 4
- Added to Group 1: `Mapp för omdöpt pdf: [____] [Välj mapp] [ ]Lås`
- Added reset button below for clearing selection

**User Benefits**:
- Full control over where renamed PDFs are saved
- Can organize PDFs into any folder structure
- Lock prevents accidental folder changes
- Defaults to same directory if no folder selected

### v1.16.18 Success Story (2025-07-29) - Text Field Bug Resolution ✅
**Achievement**: After 17+ versions and multiple failed approaches, the nuclear option definitively solved all text editing issues

**Critical Bugs FIXED**:
- ✅ **Regular undo while typing**: Now works character-by-character (was undoing large chunks)
- ✅ **Undo after formatting**: No longer jumps way back inappropriately  
- ✅ **Copy/paste with formatting**: Format preservation works perfectly (was duplicating or losing formatting)

**Nuclear Option Solution**:
- **Problem**: Global `bind_all('<Control-v>')` never worked due to ScrollableText focus hierarchy
- **Root Cause**: Focus went to ScrollableText Frame, not inner Text widget
- **Solution**: Direct widget binding in `excel_fields.py`:
  ```python
  text_widget.bind('<Control-v>', lambda e: self.parent.handle_paste_undo(text_widget))
  ```
- **Result**: Bypassed all tkinter hierarchy issues completely

**User Testing Confirmation**:
- Multiple successful paste operations in all Text fields (Händelse, Note1-3)
- Proper undo state management working
- No crashes, no duplicate paste, no formatting loss
- Excel integration continues working flawlessly

**Technical Breakthrough**: The key was abandoning the global binding approach and binding directly to each individual Text widget, passing the widget reference directly to the handler.

### Current Application Features:
- ✅ **Output Folder Selection**: Flexible destination for renamed PDFs with session-only lock and folder opening
- ✅ **Scrollable Text Widgets**: All text fields (Händelse, Note1-3) now have vertical scrollbars
- ✅ **Excel File Persistence**: App remembers selected Excel file between sessions
- ✅ **Full-Window Scrollbar**: Canvas-based scrolling for low-resolution screen support
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Reduced Ruff warnings from 117 to 36 (69% improvement)
- ✅ **Date/Time Validation**: Comprehensive validation system with multiple trigger events
- ✅ **Tab Navigation**: Validation triggers correctly on Tab key press with format conversion
- ✅ **Save Button Validation**: Pre-save validation runs before other checks, prevents bad data
- ✅ **Format Conversion**: Automatic formatting (1530→15:30, 20250728→2025-07-28)
- ✅ **Century Validation**: Rejects YY-MM-DD/YYMMDD with "Du måste ange århundrade" error
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear error messages with field names and current values
- ✅ **Event Bindings**: FocusOut, Return, Tab triggers for natural user workflow
- ✅ **Rich Text Persistence**: Bold, italic, and color formatting preserved across app sessions
- ✅ **Time Fields**: Starttid and Sluttid with HH:MM validation and auto-formatting
- ✅ **19 Excel Columns**: All original fields plus new time fields
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: PDF processing, Excel integration, locked fields all working

## Known Issues

**What Works**:
- ✅ Mixed formatting displays correctly (e.g., plain text followed by red text)
- ✅ Format changes within text preserve all formatting correctly
- ✅ All text content is preserved and visible in Excel cells
- ✅ Complex combinations work (e.g., plain + red + blue text)

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ Single uniform formatting disappears (e.g., text that is only red)
- ❌ Combined uniform formatting disappears (e.g., text that is only bold + red)
- **Pattern**: Text disappears if there's only one format applied to entire cell content

**Technical Note**: The issue is in the xlsxwriter rich text API handling of uniform formatting in `core/excel_manager.py`. There needs to be a change of format within the text for it to be preserved.

### Window Height on External Monitors
**STATUS**: Functional workaround in place
- ✅ **Laptop screens**: Full functionality, all elements visible
- ⚠️ **External monitors**: Slightly shortened window (800px max) but fully functional
- **Impact**: Minimal - all features accessible, status bar visible
- **Future improvement**: Dynamic height adjustment based on screen size

## Things That Remain To Do

**NOTE**: The major text field editing bugs (undo/paste/formatting) have been completely resolved in v1.16.18. Remaining issues are lower priority enhancements.

### High Priority Issues
1. **Rich Text Uniform Formatting Bug** (Excel Export)
   - **Status**: Affects Excel output only, GUI works perfectly
   - **Issue**: Text with uniform formatting (all red, all bold) disappears in Excel
   - **Location**: `core/excel_manager.py` xlsxwriter rich text API handling
   - **Workaround**: Use mixed formatting within text

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - **Ruff Warnings**: 36 remaining style/import warnings to clean up (reduced from 117)
   - **Location**: Multiple files, mostly whitespace and import organization
   - **Impact**: No functional issues, but affects code maintainability

### Medium Priority Enhancements
3. **Window Height Optimization**
   - **Goal**: Dynamic height adjustment based on screen size
   - **Current**: Fixed 800px max height workaround
   - **Impact**: Slightly shortened window on large external monitors

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - **GUI Responsiveness**: Consider lazy loading for large Excel files
   - **Memory Usage**: Review memory footprint for long sessions

### Low Priority Future Features
5. **Excel Macro Support** (.xlsm files)
   - **Status**: Previously attempted but reverted due to hybrid method conflicts
   - **Challenge**: Cannot compromise critical hybrid Excel writing approach
   - **Alternative**: Consider separate handling for .xlsm vs .xlsx files

6. **Enhanced Rich Text Features**
   - **Underline Support**: Add underline formatting option
   - **Font Size Control**: Variable font sizes within text fields

**Status**: Successfully completed and tested - application works perfectly

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `gui/dialogs.py` with `DialogManager` class
- Extracted 4 dialog methods (~540 lines removed from main_window.py):
  - `show_excel_help()` - Excel file requirements dialog
  - `create_excel_template()` - Creates new Excel template files
  - `handle_paste_event()` - Smart paste handling with length checking
  - `handle_text_splitting()` - Splits long text across multiple fields
- Updated main_window.py to use `self.dialog_manager.method()` pattern
- **Result**: v1.9.3 tested and confirmed working perfectly

### Phase 2: Excel Field Management (v1.9.5) - ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
**Goal**: Extract Excel field creation and management from main_window.py
**Status**: Successfully completed after layout fix - application fully functional

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `gui/excel_fields.py` with `ExcelFieldManager` class  
- Extracted 6 Excel field methods (~400-500 lines from main_window.py):
  - `collect_locked_field_data()` - Collects locked field states and contents
  - `restore_locked_fields()` - Restores saved locked field data
  - `save_locked_fields_on_exit()` - Saves locked fields before exit
  - `clear_excel_fields()` - Clears non-locked Excel fields
  - `create_excel_fields()` - Creates dynamic Excel fields layout
  - `create_field_in_frame()` - Creates individual field widgets
- **Critical Learning**: Initial v1.9.4 broke layout by changing grid-based system
- **Solution**: Restored exact v1.9.3 layout code while maintaining manager pattern
- **Result**: v1.9.5 tested and confirmed - perfect 3-column layout with all functionality

### Future Phases (Optional Improvements)
**Status**: Core refactoring complete, application fully stable

3. **Extract Event Handlers** (Medium complexity)
4. **Extract GUI Group Creation** (High complexity)

**Current Priority**: Application is fully functional and well-organized. Future phases are optional optimizations.

## Important Development Rules
- **Never edit** `APP DJs Timeline-verktyg v170 FUNKAR.py` - this is the old single-file version (kept as backup)
- **Always use** `app.py` as the starting point for the refactored modular version
- **Never** try to change the Excel hybrid methods without asking the user - v1.7.4 contains the only working solution
- **Preserve working code**: When refactoring, extract code exactly as-is, don't "improve" during extraction
- **Test immediately**: After any structural changes, test the application thoroughly
- **Grid layout is sacred**: The three-column Excel fields layout uses grid with `uniform="col"` - never change this
- Any changes should be made to the modular files in core/ and gui/ directories

## Refactoring Lessons Learned
- **Working code is sacred**: During refactoring, preserve exact functionality and layout
- **Extract, don't improve**: Make structural changes separate from functional improvements
- **Test after each step**: Verify functionality before making additional changes
- **Layout systems matter**: Grid-based layouts with `uniform` distribution are critical for UI consistency

## Development Notes

- All GUI components are built using ttkbootstrap
- Logging is configured for debugging
- No automated tests are present in the codebase
- No build process required - runs directly with Python interpreter
- **Current version**: v1.17.3 (stable master with session-only lock and folder opening functionality)
- **Last tested**: 2025-07-29 - All v1.17.3 improvements verified working, optimal UX balance achieved

### v1.16.18 Success (2025-07-29) - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Text Field Bug Resolution
**Achievement**: Completely resolved all persistent text field editing bugs with nuclear option approach

**Critical Problem Solved**:
After 17+ versions of failed attempts, the paste functionality in Text fields (Händelse, Note1-3) was completely broken. Multiple approaches failed:
- Global `bind_all('<Control-v>')` approach (v1.16.9-v1.16.17)
- Class binding overrides with `bind_class` 
- ScrollableText focus detection and redirection
- Emergency reality checks with debug output and GUI popups

**Nuclear Option Solution**:
- **Root Cause**: ScrollableText wrapper caused focus to go to Frame instead of inner Text widget
- **Breakthrough**: Direct widget binding in `excel_fields.py`:
  ```python
  text_widget.bind('<Control-v>', lambda e: self.parent.handle_paste_undo(text_widget))
  ```
- **Result**: Bypassed all tkinter hierarchy and focus issues completely

**Bugs Definitively Fixed**:

**Result**: Header stuck at very top (overcorrection)
**Lesson**: Need bottom alignment, not top alignment

### v1.15.1 Success (2025-07-25) - Date/Time Field Alignment Refinement
**Achievement**: Perfected symmetrical alignment of date/time fields

**Alignment Improvements**:
- ✅ **Grid-Based Layout**: Replaced pack with grid for precise positioning
- ✅ **Fixed Label Width**: Set minsize=85px for consistent label alignment
- ✅ **Column Structure**: Organized as Label | Entry | Lock Switch
- ✅ **Visual Symmetry**: Perfect alignment between left/right columns

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implemented grid layout with fixed column widths
- Left column: Startdatum + Starttid with consistent spacing
- Right column: Slutdatum + Sluttid with matching alignment
- Increased inter-column spacing (10px) for better visual separation

### v1.15.0 Success (2025-07-25) - Initial Date/Time Field Layout
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented two-column subgroup for date/time fields

**New Features Added**:
- ✅ **Two-Column Subgroup**: Date/time fields organized in a compact 2x2 grid above Händelse
- ✅ **Space Optimization**: Date/time fields only use minimal required space
- ✅ **Better Visual Grouping**: Related fields (start date/time, end date/time) side by side
- ✅ **Händelse Expansion**: Händelse field now gets all remaining vertical space

**Technical Implementation**:
- Created `_create_datetime_fields_in_subframe()` method for specialized layout
- Modified column 2 structure with fixed-height date/time row (weight=0)
- Händelse placed in expandable row (weight=1) to fill available space
- Left column: Startdatum + Starttid with lock switches
- Right column: Slutdatum + Sluttid with lock switches

**Layout Benefits**:
- More efficient use of vertical space in middle column
- Logical grouping of related date/time fields
- Maximum space for Händelse text entry
- All functionality preserved (validation, lock switches, etc.)

### v1.14.0 Success (2025-07-25) - Rich Text Format Preservation
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented rich text format preservation for locked fields

**New Features Added**:
- ✅ **Rich Text Persistence**: Bold, italic, and color formatting preserved across app sessions
- ✅ **Format Serialization**: Tkinter text tags converted to JSON-compatible format
- ✅ **Locked Field Enhancement**: Note1, Note2, Note3, Händelse fields preserve formatting when locked
- ✅ **Configuration Integration**: Format data stored in new "locked_field_formats" config section
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing configuration files

**Technical Implementation**:
- `serialize_text_widget_formatting()`: Converts tkinter tags to JSON format
- `restore_text_widget_formatting()`: Restores tags from JSON data
- Updated `collect_locked_field_data()` to include formatting data
- Updated `restore_locked_fields()` to apply saved formatting
- Support for tags: bold, italic, red, blue, green, black

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ **Perfect Format Preservation**: All tested formatting combinations work correctly
- ✅ **Mixed Formatting**: Complex combinations within single field preserved
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Formatting survives app close/restart cycles
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Safe recovery from invalid tag positions
- ✅ **Performance**: Minimal overhead, only processes locked fields with formatting

### v1.13.0 Success (2025-07-25) - Time Fields Implementation
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented time fields with validation while preserving Excel hybrid method

**New Features Added**:
- ✅ **Starttid and Sluttid fields**: HH:MM format with auto-formatting and validation
- ✅ **Time validation**: 24-hour format (00:00-23:59) with HHMM→HH:MM conversion
- ✅ **19 Excel columns**: Expanded from 17 to include new time fields
- ✅ **Column 2 layout**: Time fields positioned above Händelse field
- ✅ **Lock switches**: Added for new time fields (17 total lock states)

**Preserved Functionality**:
- ✅ **Excel hybrid method**: Sacred v1.7.4 approach maintained
- ✅ **GUI layout**: Three-column structure with proper field distribution
- ✅ **Mixed rich text**: Format changes within text work correctly

### Critical Reversion History (2025-07-24)
**Background**: Previous attempt (v1.9.12) broke Excel hybrid method with automatic header migration and direct openpyxl saving calls. Complete reversion to v1.9.8 was required to restore working baseline.

**Key Lesson**: Excel hybrid method changes require explicit user permission and thorough testing.
