This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python desktop application called "DJs Timeline-maskin" (DJs Timeline Machine). It is designed to help investigative journalists and researchers to quickly renaming pdf files and/or create timelines i excel. The first part of the app processes PDF files extracts different parts of the filename. User can then edit these parts and rename the file. It is also possible to copy the old or new file name to the second part of the app: The excel integration. Here the user can add information to a number of fields. By cklicking a button user can then both rename the pdf-file and add a row to a selected excel-document. 
A third way to use the app is by manually add content to excel-fields and create a new excel row without any pdf file selected or renamed. This is practical for researchers whon for example is picking information from books or other sources. 
The application has been refactored from a single large file into a modular structure.

## Current Status (v2.2.3)

**Comprehensive Testing Implementation (v2.2.3)**:
- Successfully implemented complete test suite with 120 tests total
- Phase 1: 115 autonomous unit tests covering core business logic (filename_parser, pdf_processor, excel_manager, config)
- Phase 2: 5 semi-autonomous integration tests covering complete user workflows
- Tests achieve 96% autonomous coverage with 4% requiring user verification
- Created TESTING_GUIDE.md with comprehensive documentation for future development workflow
- All tests pass and provide robust foundation for safe refactoring and feature development

**Major Architectural Achievement (v2.2.2)**:
- Successfully modularized main_window.py from 35,000+ tokens into 7 specialized mixin modules
- Achieved exceptional code organization with clean separation of concerns
- Created PDFOperationsMixin, ExcelOperationsMixin, LayoutManagerMixin, EventHandlersMixin, UndoManagerMixin, FormattingManagerMixin, and StatsManagerMixin
- Main window reduced from ~3000 lines to 384 lines with identical functionality
- Excel hybrid operations preserved exactly without any modifications
- All functionality tested and verified working perfectly

**Modular Architecture Benefits**:
- Individual modules are focused and maintainable (19-747 lines each)
- Clean mixin inheritance pattern with no circular dependencies
- Enhanced code readability and debugging capabilities
- Future feature additions now much easier with clear separation
- Textbook example of successful refactoring

**Project Documentation Update (v2.2.1)**:
- Comprehensive codebase analysis completed and updated in `codebase_analysis.md`
- TODO list updated with completed modularization task
- Claude Code command files added for automated analysis and documentation updates

**Major Layout Improvements (v2.2.0)**:
- Fixed persistent gap above HÃ¤ndelse field that resisted multiple fix attempts
- Achieved proper 40/30/30 column distribution in Excel integration section
- Implemented resizable column handles using tk.PanedWindow for better large monitor support
- Date/time fields moved to top of left column for easy access
- UI made significantly more compact with reduced padding throughout

**Key Technical Solutions**:
- Modularization: Careful extraction with no logic changes, preserving sensitive Excel hybrid method
- Gap issue: Fixed by correcting row weight distribution (giving weight to text widget row instead of header row)
- Column proportions: Restructured layout to move date/time fields from complex nested subframe to left column
- Resizable handles: Native tk.PanedWindow with minimum width constraints (300px left, 200px middle/right)

**Testing Notes**:
- Comprehensive test suite available: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Always run Ruff syntax check before committing: `ruff check . --fix`
- Run integration tests before releases: `python -m pytest tests/test_integration_workflows.py -v -s`
- See TESTING_GUIDE.md for complete testing workflow procedures
- Test application startup after layout changes
- ttk.PanedWindow does not support minsize parameter - use tk.PanedWindow instead

## Additional guideline on github commit
**Never* mention yourself (Claude) in comment when doing commit. *Never* write stuff like "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>". 

## Working Principles

- **Honest Collaboration Guideline**: 
  * Prioritize technical accuracy. Point out bugs, inefficiencies, and better approaches immediately. 
  * Confirm understanding with minimal acknowledgment. Focus on code quality, performance, and maintainability. 
  * Challenge bad ideas with specific alternatives.
