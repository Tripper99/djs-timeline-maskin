# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python desktop application called "DJs Timeline-maskin" (DJs Timeline Machine). It is designed to help investigative journalists and researchers to quickly renaming pdf files and/or create timelines i excel. The first part of the app processes PDF files extracts different parts of the filename. User can then edit these parts and rename the file. It is also possible to copy the old or new file name to the second part of the app: The excel integration. Here the user can add information to a number of fields. By cklicking a button user can then both rename the pdf-file and add a row to a selected excel-document. 
A third way to use the app is by manually add content to excel-fields and create a new excel row without any pdf file selected or renamed. This is practical for researchers whon for example is picking information from books or other sources. 
The application has been refactored from a single large file into a modular structure.

## Current Status (v2.5.9)

**Latest Achievement (v2.5.9)**: Successfully resolved all field configuration dialog alignment issues through complete architectural redesign. Implemented fixed-width container architecture achieving pixel-perfect field alignment - all entry fields now have uniform width and position regardless of field type (protected, required, editable) or label length. Revolutionary solution using transparent container frames with modular helper methods provides maintainable, future-proof layout system.

**Key Features**:
- **Field Protection Consistency**: KÃ¤lla field now protected like Startdatum and HÃ¤ndelse (cannot be renamed or disabled)
- **Visual Consistency**: All fields always visible with disabled fields clearly indicated through professional grayed-out styling
- **Layout Stability**: No more sparse, unbalanced interface when fields are disabled
- **Centralized Styling System**: Professional disabled field appearance with consistent graying, italic labels, and non-interactive state
- **Excel Safety**: Disabled fields automatically excluded from Excel operations while maintaining visual presence
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with internal terminology updates and configuration migration
- **Template Management**: Enhanced template system supports both old and new field state formats
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 120 test suite plus specialized field state validation confirms all functionality works correctly

**Architecture Status**:
- **Modular Design**: Clean architecture with main_window.py reduced from 35,000+ tokens to 384 lines
- **Field State System**: Complete transition from "hidden" to "disabled" terminology with backward compatibility aliases
- **Visual Styling**: New centralized field styling system (gui/field_styling.py) for consistent disabled field appearance
- **Excel Integration**: Enhanced to show all fields while respecting field state for operations

**Testing Framework**:
- Comprehensive test suite available: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Always run Ruff syntax check before committing: `ruff check . --fix`
- Integration tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_integration_workflows.py -v -s`
- See TESTING_GUIDE.md for complete workflow procedures

## Documentation Management Guidelines

**CLAUDE.md Content Strategy**:
- Keep CLAUDE.md focused on current status and working principles only
- Include only the very latest development achievement (current version) in Current Status section
- Remove older development history when adding new entries to prevent document growth
- For detailed development history, technical analysis, and version milestones â†’ use `docs\DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`
- Always reference DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md for comprehensive historical details
- Maintain clean, actionable guidance rather than extensive historical records

**Development History Documentation**:
- Comprehensive technical details, root cause analyses, and implementation insights go in `docs\DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`
- Each major version should have detailed entry with problem/solution/technical excellence documentation
- Include investigation methodology, sub-agent usage, and development process insights
- Preserve valuable technical knowledge for future development sessions

## Additional guideline on github commit
**Never* mention yourself (Claude) in comment when doing commit. *Never* write stuff like "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>". 

## Working Principles

- **Honest Collaboration Guideline**: 
  * Prioritize technical accuracy. Point out bugs, inefficiencies, and better approaches immediately. 
  * Confirm understanding with minimal acknowledgment. Focus on code quality, performance, and maintainability. 
  * Challenge bad ideas with specific alternatives.

- **UX Validation & Bug Investigation Approach** (learned in v2.2.15):
  * Use specialized sub-agents (bug-finder-debugger) for systematic investigation of behavioral issues
  * Always compare working vs non-working patterns to identify root cause differences
  * Focus on user experience consistency - fields of same type should behave identically
  * Distinguish between data validation (necessary) and UX validation (can be overly aggressive)
  * Document specific code locations and event bindings when investigating GUI behavior issues
  * Test behavioral changes thoroughly to ensure consistent UX across similar UI elements

- **Systematic Feature Implementation Approach** (learned in v2.3.0):
  * Use complete rewrite architecture with GitHub fallback safety for major features
  * Separate identity systems (internal IDs vs display names) for flexibility and maintainability  
  * Create comprehensive validation frameworks with real-time feedback and visual indicators
  * Design professional configuration interfaces with clear protected/modifiable sections
  * Implement complete reset mechanisms with warning dialogs for data-destructive operations
  * Always identify and document any remaining bugs with specific fix plans for next session
  * Use specialized sub-agents (architecture-planner, code-writer) for systematic implementation phases

- **Critical Bug Investigation Methodology** (learned in v2.3.3 & v2.5.1):
  * Use multiple specialized subagents (bug-finder-debugger, architecture-planner, code-reviewer-refactorer) for systematic root cause analysis
  * Trace complete data flow from configuration â†’ storage â†’ usage to identify exact failure points
  * Search for architectural inconsistencies - look for pattern violations (e.g., 9 methods use correct approach, 1 uses wrong approach)
  * Add comprehensive debug logging at every critical data transition point
  * Verify fixes work for all edge cases and don't cause regression in existing functionality
  * Use systematic investigation with sub-agents rather than assumptions - they often reveal deeper architectural insights
  * Document exact sequence of events and technical solutions for future reference

- **Major UI/UX Transformation Methodology** (learned in v2.5.2):
  * Break complex transformations into distinct phases with clear deliverables and testing milestones
  * Use specialized sub-agents extensively for architecture planning, code generation, and validation
  * Maintain comprehensive backward compatibility through alias systems during terminology transitions
  * Create centralized systems (like field styling) to ensure consistency across large codebases
  * Always verify that core business logic (Excel operations) remains unchanged during UI transformations
  * Test systematically after each phase rather than at the end - complex changes require incremental validation
  * Document phase completion and commit incremental progress to enable rollback if needed

- **mandatory git commit routine**
  * Before writing code you should always make a new version and commit it to git with comments on what you are about to do. 
  * After making changes the user must get an oportunity to do testruns. 
  * If and when user says that changes works, you should do a new commit, with comments reflecting the successful code change. 
  * Never write comments about successful revisions unless the user has done test runs. 
- When presenting a plan for code change always start the plan with saving of new version and git commit. The reason for this is that user can't approav plan if he is not sure that you will remember the backup procedure.
