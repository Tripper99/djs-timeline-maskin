### v2.3.3 Field Names Display Bug Fix (2025-08-17) - Critical Bug Fix ✅
**Achievement**: Fixed critical bug where custom field names were saved correctly but not displayed in main UI after applying changes.

**Problem Solved**:
- **Bug Report**: Custom field names configured in dialog not showing in main application window
- **Root Cause**: `_on_field_config_applied()` method called `clear_config()` which deleted the entire config file immediately after custom names were saved
- **Investigation**: Used systematic bug-finder-debugger and architecture-planner agents to trace complete data flow

**Technical Solution Implemented**:
- **Core Fix**: Removed `self.config_manager.clear_config()` from `_on_field_config_applied()` method 
- **Data Flow**: Preserved config file containing custom field names during field configuration reset
- **Selective Reset**: Changed from complete config deletion to selective user data clearing only
- **Debug Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging throughout custom field name data flow for future troubleshooting

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```
1. Dialog saves custom names to config ✅
2. Dialog calls _on_field_config_applied() ✅  
3. Method calls clear_config() which deletes entire config file ❌
4. Method tries to reload custom names but they're gone ❌
5. field_manager gets empty {} and UI shows default names ❌
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Modified**: `gui/main_window.py` - Removed config deletion, added debug logging
- **Enhanced**: Custom field name tracking through complete application lifecycle
- **Verified**: Works for both first-time users (no config) and existing users (config exists)

**Development Process Insights**:
- **Agent Usage**: Systematically used bug-finder-debugger to trace data flow and identify exact failure point

### v2.2.15 Time Field Validation UX Fix (2025-08-16) - Critical UX Issue ✅
**Achievement**: Fixed time field validation behavior to match date fields, eliminating forced validation on empty field focus loss.

**Problem Solved**: 
- **User Trap Issue**: Time fields (Starttid, Sluttid) were showing validation errors when users clicked away without entering data
- **Inconsistent UX**: Date fields worked correctly (placeholder text restoration, no error), but time fields forced validation
- **Poor Workflow**: Users were trapped by error messages just for clicking elsewhere without input

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- **Bug-finder-debugger Agent Analysis**: Used specialized agent to investigate behavioral differences
- **Technical Discovery**: Time fields had aggressive FocusOut validation binding (`gui/excel_fields.py:650`) while date fields didn't
- **Code Location**: `entry.bind('<FocusOut>', lambda e, field=col_name: self.parent.validate_time_field(e, field))`
- **Validation Logic**: Both field types handled empty input correctly, but time fields enforced validation on focus loss

**Technical Solution**:
- **Removed FocusOut Binding**: Eliminated the problematic validation binding from time fields
- **Consistent Behavior**: Time fields now behave identically to date fields
- **Maintained Data Integrity**: Time validation still occurs during save operations
- **Clean Implementation**: Simple fix with clear code comments explaining the change

- **Lesson**: Reinforced importance of comprehensive syntax checking before commits

**Session Persistence Features**:
- **Column Width Memory**: Excel column sash positions automatically saved to config and restored on startup
- **Proportional Scaling**: Saved positions adapt to different screen sizes maintaining user preferences  
- **Smart Fallbacks**: New users get sensible 40/30/30 defaults, existing users keep customized layouts
- **Color Button State Reset**: Visual selection states properly reset after save operations

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Sash Position Saving**: Implemented in `on_closing()` with error handling for edge cases
- **Proportional Restoration**: Calculate relative positions based on total width changes
- **Manual Entry-StringVar Binding**: Custom solution for placeholder text visibility with CustomTkinter
- **Enhanced Save Logic**: Added `_select_row_color("none")` call in `save_all_and_clear()`

### v2.2.10 Placeholder Text & Polish (2025-08-15) - UX Enhancement ✅

### v2.2.0 Resizable Column Handles (2025-08-15) - Major UX Enhancement ✅
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented resizable column handles with native drag functionality for better large monitor support.

**Core Problem Solved**: Left column compression on large monitors (especially 1920x1080+) made the application barely usable due to inadequate field width.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **PanedWindow Integration**: Replaced grid-based layout with tk.PanedWindow for native resize handles
- **Minimum Width Protection**: Set constraints (300px left, 200px middle/right) to prevent over-compression
- **Automatic Positioning**: Initial 40/30/30 distribution maintained with automated sash positioning
- **Mixed Widget Architecture**: tk.PanedWindow container with CustomTkinter styled content

**Key Development Insights**:
- **Critical Error Discovered**: ttk.PanedWindow does NOT support minsize parameter (causes "unknown option -minsize" error)
- **Solution**: Use tk.PanedWindow which has native minsize support

### v2.1.9 Gap Issue Resolution (2025-08-15) - Critical Layout Fix ✅
**Achievement**: Finally eliminated the persistent gap above Händelse field after multiple debugging attempts.

**Problem Solving Process**:
1. **Initial Attempts Failed**: Multiple confident "solutions" targeting padding, sticky values, frame nesting
2. **Test Script Creation**: Built standalone reproduction (`test_excel_layout.py`) to isolate the issue
3. **Key Insight**: User observation about yellow header frame differences between columns
4. **Root Cause Discovery**: `col2_frame.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)` was expanding the header row instead of text widget row

**Technical Solution**:
- **Correct Fix**: Changed `grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)` to `grid_rowconfigure(2, weight=1)`
- **Logic**: Give expansion weight to text widget row (row 2) instead of header row (row 0)
- **Result**: Header/toolbar stay compact at top, only text area expands vertically

**Development Lessons**:
- **Systematic Debugging**: Creating isolated test scripts more effective than guessing
- **User Observations**: Critical insights often come from user feedback about visual differences
- **Weight Distribution**: Grid row weights must target the correct row for intended expansion behavior
- **Persistence Required**: Complex layout issues may require multiple investigation approaches

### v2.1.8 Major Layout Restructuring (2025-08-15) - Foundation Work ✅

- **Layout Simplification**: Eliminated complex datetime subframe nesting (reduced from 4 to 2 levels)
- **Weight System Fix**: Corrected column weights from (2,1,1) to (4,3,3) for true 40/30/30 distribution

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Nesting Reduction**: Simplified 4-level deep frame structure
- **Space Optimization**: Reduced card shadow spacing, main container padding, internal frame spacing
- **Field Reorganization**: Date/time fields at top of left column for easy access
- **Middle Column Cleanup**: Exclusively for Händelse field without nested complications

### v2.1.7 Failed Responsive Layout Attempt (2025-08-14) - Learning Experience ❌
**Problem**: Attempted to solve horizontal space constraints with responsive smart grid layout that was making left column fields barely readable on both 1920x1080 and 2560x1600 screens.

**Implementation Attempted**:
- **Screen Detection System**: Dynamic breakpoints (small/medium/large/xlarge) based on screen width
- **Intelligent Field Grouping**: Organized 18 fields into logical groups (metadata, datetime, content, notes, sources)
- **Dynamic Column Distribution**: 2-4 columns based on screen size with smart field allocation
- **Responsive Grid Manager**: Complex column weight calculation and field placement algorithms

**Technical Scope**:
- Added screen detection with 4 layout configurations (< 1600px, 1600-2200px, 2200-2800px, > 2800px)
- Created field grouping system with 5 logical categories
- Implemented dynamic column creation with intelligent weight distribution
- Modified ExcelFieldManager with 200+ lines of responsive logic

**Result**: Made GUI significantly worse instead of better
- Layout became more cramped and confusing
- Field organization was less intuitive than original 3-column structure
- Complex responsive logic created unpredictable behavior
- User immediately requested reversion after testing

**Resolution**: Clean reversion to stable v2.1.6
- Used `git reset --hard 22b5533` to restore v2.1.6 completely
- All responsive layout code removed
- Original 3-column layout (40%/30%/30%) restored
- Version number corrected back to v2.1.6

**Lessons Learned**:

### v1.19.2 Output Folder Lock Persistence Fixed (2025-07-30) - Consistent Lock Behavior ✅
**Achievement**: Output folder lock switch now persists between sessions like all other lock switches

**Problem**: The output folder lock switch was implemented with "session-only behavior" - it always started unlocked on app startup, unlike all other lock switches which preserve their state between sessions.

**Root Cause**: Three methods had deliberate session-only implementation:
- `load_saved_output_folder()` forced lock switch to False on startup
- `on_output_folder_lock_change()` didn't save lock state to config  
- `on_closing()` didn't preserve output folder lock state

**Solution Implementation**:
1. **Modified `load_saved_output_folder()`**: Now loads actual saved `output_folder_locked` state from config
2. **Modified `on_output_folder_lock_change()`**: Now saves lock state to config when user changes it
3. **Modified `on_closing()`**: Now saves current output folder lock state before app exit
4. **Version Update**: v1.19.1 → v1.19.2

**User Benefits**:
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: All lock switches now work identically
- ✅ **User Convenience**: No need to re-enable output folder lock every session
- ✅ **Workflow Improvement**: Lock state remembered across app restarts
- ✅ **Intuitive Operation**: Behavior matches user expectations

**Technical Verification**:
- Config file correctly shows `"output_folder_locked": true` when saved
- Lock state loads properly on app startup
- User testing confirmed fix works as intended

### v1.18.2 Stable Reset (2025-07-30) - Recovery from Critical Config Issues ✅
**Achievement**: Successfully identified and resolved critical config saving issues by resetting to stable v1.18.2

**Problem Discovered**: 
Versions v1.18.3 and v1.18.4 contained critical bugs that broke the config saving mechanism. Despite appearing to work normally, these versions failed to save locked field data when closing the application, causing user data loss.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **v1.18.3**: Icon implementation accidentally broke the `setup_gui()` method structure
- **v1.18.4**: Attempt to fix v1.18.3 created duplicate/incomplete method definitions
- **Core Issue**: `on_closing()` method was never called due to incomplete window protocol binding setup
- **Symptom**: App could read config data but couldn't save new changes

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Smart Reset Strategy**: Instead of complex debugging, reset to known working state (v1.18.2)
2. **Issue Identification**: Discovered `setup_gui()` method structural problems in later versions
3. **Verification**: Confirmed v1.18.2 has fully working config saving mechanism
4. **Testing**: Validated locked fields, rich text formatting, and all config persistence works correctly

**Key Lessons Learned**:
- **Simple Changes First**: Config filename changes should be minimal, not complex debugging sessions
- **Working Baseline**: Always maintain a known working version for fallback
- **Method Structure Critical**: Window protocol binding setup must complete properly for config saving
- **Testing Saves Time**: Quick reset to working version faster than extensive debugging

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ **Config Saving Works**: All locked fields and rich text formatting preserved across sessions
- ✅ **Stable Foundation**: Ready for simple config filename change from solid base
- ✅ **Clean Codebase**: No broken method structures or incomplete implementations

Color buttons (Red, Blue, Green) were using ttkbootstrap's theme-dependent styles (danger, primary, success) which changed colors based on the selected theme. This made it impossible for users to identify button functions when switching themes.

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Fixed Color Buttons**: Red (#DC3545), Green (#28A745), Blue (#007BFF) remain constant
- **Theme Persistence**: Custom button styles reapplied after theme changes
- **Button Reordering**: Changed order from Red-Blue-Green to Red-Green-Blue as requested
- **Clean Implementation**: Centralized style configuration in configure_button_styles() method

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def configure_button_styles(self):
    """Configure custom button styles with fixed colors that persist across theme changes"""
    style = tb.Style()
    
    # Configure custom button styles with fixed colors
    style.configure('Red.TButton', background='#DC3545', foreground='white')
    style.map('Red.TButton',
              background=[('active', '#C82333'), ('pressed', '#BD2130')])
    
    style.configure('Green.TButton', background='#28A745', foreground='white')
    style.map('Green.TButton',
              background=[('active', '#218838'), ('pressed', '#1E7E34')])
    
    style.configure('Blue.TButton', background='#007BFF', foreground='white')
    style.map('Blue.TButton',
              background=[('active', '#0069D9'), ('pressed', '#0056B3')])

# Called in change_theme() to reapply styles after theme changes
```

### v1.17.17 Success (2025-07-30) - Strict Validation System Implementation ✅
**Achievement**: Implemented comprehensive validation system requiring both Startdatum and Händelse fields for Excel row creation, while maintaining PDF-only operation capability

**Problem Solved**: 
Users needed strict control over Excel row creation to maintain timeline data quality. Previously, Excel rows could be created with incomplete critical information, making timeline analysis unreliable. Also needed to preserve the ability to rename PDF files without Excel validation requirements.

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Strict Validation**: Both Startdatum AND Händelse must be filled for any Excel row creation
- **PDF-Only Operations**: PDF renaming works independently when both required fields are empty
- **Enhanced User Guidance**: Clear error messages with hints about PDF-only functionality
- **Correct Logic Flow**: Fixed "nothing to do" scenarios and combined operation handling

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Simple, clear logic in save_all_and_clear():
needs_pdf_rename = self.current_pdf_path and self.has_filename_changed()
needs_excel_row = startdatum_content and handelse_content

# Handle scenarios based on clear requirements
if not needs_pdf_rename and not needs_excel_row:
    show_nothing_to_do_message()
elif (startdatum_content or handelse_content) and not (startdatum_content and handelse_content):
    show_validation_error_with_guidance()
else:
    perform_operations_and_show_results()
```

**Architecture Improvements**:
- Replaced complex overlapping validation systems with single, linear logic
- Simplified helper methods to avoid conflicts
- Clear separation between PDF operations and Excel operations
- Eliminated redundant field checking and validation loops

**Testing Results** ✅:
- PDF-only rename (empty required fields): Works without Excel validation ✅
- Excel-only creation (both fields filled): Creates row correctly ✅
- Combined operations (PDF + Excel): Both operations complete successfully ✅
- Partial field filling: Shows clear validation message with guidance ✅
- Nothing to do scenario: Shows correct "nothing to do" message ✅
- All existing functionality: Preserved without regressions ✅

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Clear error messages: "Både Startdatum och Händelse måste vara ifyllda för att en ny excelrad ska kunna skrivas"
- Helpful guidance: "Om du bara vill byta namn på en pdf så se till så att fälten Startdatum och Händelse är tomma"
- Appropriate focus management on validation errors
- Distinct status messages for different operation types

### v1.17.16 Success (2025-07-29) - Uniform Formatting Excel Export Fix ✅
**Achievement**: Fixed critical bug where uniformly formatted text (all red, all bold, etc.) disappeared in Excel export

**Problem Solved**: 
Text fields with uniform formatting throughout (e.g., entire field red, entire field bold) now display correctly in Excel. This was a critical issue affecting investigative journalists who use consistent formatting for important information.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- `xlsxwriter.write_rich_string()` designed for mixed formatting patterns like `["text", format1, "bold", format2, "italic"]`
- Uniform formatting created edge case: `[format_obj, "entire text content"]` 
- This pattern caused xlsxwriter to fail silently, resulting in empty Excel cells
- Documentation research confirmed write_rich_string() limitations with single-format scenarios

**Technical Solution**:
```python
# Detection logic in _write_rich_text_xlsxwriter():
if (len(rich_parts) == 2 and 
    hasattr(rich_parts[0], '__class__') and 'Format' in str(type(rich_parts[0])) and
    isinstance(rich_parts[1], str)):
    
    # UNIFORM FORMATTING: Use write() instead of write_rich_string()
    format_obj = rich_parts[0]
    text_content = rich_parts[1] 
    worksheet.write(row, col, text_content, format_obj)
    return  # Exit early
    
# MIXED FORMATTING: Continue with write_rich_string() as before
worksheet.write_rich_string(row, col, *rich_parts)
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Added smart detection after `rich_parts` construction
- Uniform formatting uses `worksheet.write()` with format object
- Mixed formatting continues using `write_rich_string()` unchanged
- All background color support preserved
- Method 2 extraction and hybrid approach completely untouched

**Testing Results** ✅:
- Uniform red text: Now displays correctly in Excel ✅
- Uniform bold text: Now displays correctly in Excel ✅  
- Uniform red+bold text: Now displays correctly in Excel ✅
- Mixed formatting: Continues working perfectly as before ✅
- Background colors: Preserved for all formatting types ✅
- No regressions detected in existing functionality ✅

**User Impact**: Critical fix for investigative journalists who rely on consistent formatting for organizing and highlighting important information in their timeline documents. The app now handles all rich text formatting scenarios correctly.

**Code Safety**: The fix adds only a specific edge case handler without modifying the core hybrid method or Method 2 extraction algorithm, ensuring maximum stability and backward compatibility.

### v1.17.15 Success (2025-07-30) - T Button Clear Formatting Fix ✅
**Achievement**: Fixed T button to properly clear ALL formatting and use correct text widget colors

**Problems Solved**: 
1. T button now removes ALL formatting (bold, italic, AND colors) instead of just colors
2. T button uses text widget's actual default color instead of theme's system color

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `clear_all_formatting()` method to replace `toggle_format("default")`
- Changed color detection from theme system color to `text_widget.cget('foreground')`
- Updated both T button command and Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut

**Key Code Changes**:
```python
# OLD: Only toggled color, kept bold/italic
command=lambda: self.toggle_format(text_widget, "default")

# NEW: Clears ALL formatting
command=lambda: self.clear_all_formatting(text_widget)

# Color detection fix - use widget's actual color
default_color = text_widget.cget('foreground')  # Instead of theme system color
```

**User Testing Results** ✅:
- Confirmed working across multiple themes (Cerculean, Simplex, Sandstone, Yeti)
- T button correctly removes bold, italic, and all color formatting
- Text restored to proper default color for each theme's text widgets
- No more light blue text in Cerculean theme!

**Impact**: Essential usability fix for the formatting toolbar. Users can now properly clear all formatting with a single button press, making text editing more intuitive and reliable.

### v1.17.14 Success (2025-07-29) - Complete Rich Text Background Color Fix ✅
**Achievement**: Completely resolved rich text background color bug with two-phase fix implementation

**Problem Solved**: Rich text fields (Händelse, Note1-3) now display background colors correctly with full preservation across Excel operations

**Root Cause Analysis** (v1.17.9-v1.17.14):
- ✅ **Phase 1 Discovery**: `xlsxwriter.write_rich_string()` requires format parameter (not separate write calls)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Discovery**: Existing rows lost background colors due to `row_color=None` in processing
- ✅ **Complete Solution**: Correct API usage + color detection for existing rows

**Two-Phase Fix Implementation**:

**Phase 1 (v1.17.13)**: Correct xlsxwriter API Usage
```python
# OLD (broken): Two separate calls
worksheet.write(row, col, "", cell_bg_format)
worksheet.write_rich_string(row, col, *rich_parts)  # Overwrites background!

# NEW (fixed): Single call with format parameter  
worksheet.write_rich_string(row, col, *rich_parts, cell_bg_format)  # Preserves background!
```

**Phase 2 (v1.17.14)**: Background Color Preservation for Existing Rows
```python
# Added _extract_row_color_from_format() method to detect existing background colors
detected_row_color = self._extract_row_color_from_format(cell_format)
self._write_rich_text_xlsxwriter(..., detected_row_color)  # Instead of None
```

**Technical Breakthrough**:
- **Color Detection System**: Maps hex colors back to row color names (#CCE5FF → "blue")
- **Existing Row Processing**: Preserves background colors when copying existing data
- **API Compliance**: Uses xlsxwriter's intended format parameter approach

**User Testing Results** ✅:
- **New rows**: Perfect background colors in all field types
- **Existing rows**: Background colors preserved when adding new rows  
- **Multiple colors**: Blue, yellow, green, pink all working correctly
- **Mixed formatting**: Bold, italic, font colors all maintained
- **Production ready**: Complete success confirmed by user screenshot

**Impact**: This was a major bug affecting core Excel functionality. The fix ensures reliable background color support across all operations, making the hybrid Excel method fully functional for professional use.

### v1.17.7 Success (2025-07-29) - UI Cleanup: Remove Redundant Font Size Button ✅
**Achievement**: Cleaned up the Excel integration section by removing redundant font size toggle button

**Problem Identified**:
After implementing individual A+ buttons in each text field toolbar (v1.17.6), there was a redundant font size toggle button in the Excel integration section, positioned next to the help button (?). This created UI clutter and confusion since users now had multiple ways to change font size.

**UI Improvement Implemented**:
- ✅ **Removed Redundant Button**: Eliminated the global A+ button from Excel integration section (lines 572-578 in main_window.py)
- ✅ **Preserved Individual Controls**: Kept the A+ buttons in each text field toolbar for direct, contextual font size control

- ✅ No broken references or functionality issues
- ✅ Clean Ruff validation with no syntax errors

### v1.17.6 Success (2025-07-29) - Bold and Italic Font Sizing Fix ✅
**Achievement**: Completely resolved the bug where bold and italic formatting didn't resize with the A+ font size toggle button

**Critical Problem Solved**:
When using the A+ button to change text size in the text fields (Händelse, Note1-3), text formatted with bold or italic would remain at the default 9pt size while normal text would resize correctly. This made formatted text appear inconsistent with the selected font size.

**Technical Root Cause**:
The `setup_text_formatting_tags()` method had hardcoded font sizes for bold and italic tags:
```python
text_widget.tag_configure("bold", font=('Arial', 9, 'bold'))      # Always 9pt
text_widget.tag_configure("italic", font=('Arial', 9, 'italic'))  # Always 9pt
```

**Complete Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Dynamic Tag Configuration**: Updated `setup_text_formatting_tags()` to read font size from config instead of hardcoded 9pt
- ✅ **Tag Update Method**: Added `update_formatting_tags()` method to update bold/italic tag fonts dynamically
- ✅ **Enhanced Font Application**: Modified `apply_text_font_size()` to update both main text font AND formatting tags
- ✅ **A+ Button Integration**: Added A+ button to all text field toolbars for easy font size toggling (9pt → 12pt → 15pt)
- ✅ **Startup Application**: Font size is now applied correctly when app starts and when text fields are created
- ✅ **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate method definitions and fixed all Ruff syntax issues

**User Benefits**:
- Font size toggle now works correctly for ALL text formatting including bold and italic

- ✅ **Regular undo while typing**: Now works character-by-character (was undoing large chunks)
- ✅ **Undo after formatting**: No longer jumps way back inappropriately  
- ✅ **Copy/paste with formatting**: Format preservation works perfectly (was duplicating or losing formatting)

**Nuclear Option Solution**:
- **Problem**: Global `bind_all('<Control-v>')` never worked due to ScrollableText focus hierarchy
- **Root Cause**: Focus went to ScrollableText Frame, not inner Text widget
- **Solution**: Direct widget binding in `excel_fields.py`:
  ```python
  text_widget.bind('<Control-v>', lambda e: self.parent.handle_paste_undo(text_widget))
  ```
- **Result**: Bypassed all tkinter hierarchy issues completely

- ✅ **v1.1.1**: Added enhanced bindings for Ctrl+A, Ctrl+V, Delete, BackSpace
- ✅ **v1.1.2**: Implemented custom undo/redo stack for Text widgets
- ✅ **Hybrid system**: Custom stack for problematic operations, tkinter's built-in for normal editing
- ✅ **Preserved functionality**: Entry widgets still work as before
- ✅ **v1.7.4** Excel hybrid method successfully implemented in Excel writing
- ✅ **v1.8.2 - v1.8.8**: Multiple attempts to fix window height for laptop compatibility
- ✅ **v1.9.0**: Added Windows DPI awareness to fix geometry detection issues
- ✅ **v1.9.1**: Fixed laptop status bar visibility by reducing Excel area padding
- ✅ **v1.9.3**: Completed Phase 1 refactoring - extracted DialogManager successfully
- ✅ **v1.9.5**: Completed Phase 2 refactoring - extracted ExcelFieldManager with layout fix

### Critical Reversion History (2025-07-24)
**Background**: Previous attempt (v1.9.12) broke Excel hybrid method with automatic header migration and direct openpyxl saving calls. Complete reversion to v1.9.8 was required to restore working baseline.

**Key Lesson**: Excel hybrid method changes require explicit user permission and thorough testing.

## Development Lessons Learned

### Refactoring Lessons
- **Working code is sacred**: During refactoring, preserve exact functionality and layout
- **Extract, don't improve**: Make structural changes separate from functional improvements
- **Test after each step**: Verify functionality before making additional changes
- **Layout systems matter**: Grid-based layouts with `uniform` distribution are critical for UI consistency

### Technical Breakthroughs
- **v1.7.4 Excel Hybrid Method**: Only working solution for rich text Excel export
- **v1.16.18 Nuclear Option**: Direct widget binding solved complex tkinter hierarchy issues
- **v1.17.8 Professional Toolbar**: Unicode characters and ttkbootstrap styling for modern appearance

### User Experience Insights
- **Session-only locks**: Balance safety with convenience
- **Professional error handling**: Retry/cancel dialogs with clear Swedish messaging
- **Contextual controls**: Place functionality where users expect it (A+ buttons in text toolbars)
- **Visual clarity**: Intuitive button design trumps compact letter codes

## Performance and Quality Improvements

### Code Quality Journey
- **v1.16.1**: Reduced Ruff issues from 117 to 36 (69% improvement)
- **Current**: All major code quality issues resolved, clean validation

### Performance Optimizations
