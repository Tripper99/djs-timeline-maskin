## Pro Tips for Success

### 🔒 Use the Lock Feature
See those toggle switches next to each field? Turn them ON for information you use often:
- Your name in "Person/sak" 
- Common categories like "Politics" or "Local News"
- Standard sources you use repeatedly

**Why it's awesome:** Locked info stays there even when you restart the app!

### 🎨 Make It Pretty with Formatting
In the big text fields (Händelse, Note1-3), you can:
- Make text **bold** for important stuff
- Use *italic* for quotes or uncertain info
- Add colors: Red for urgent, Blue for dates, Green for confirmed facts

**How:** Select text first, then click the formatting buttons!

### 📅 Date Format Matters
Always use **YYYY-MM-DD** format for dates:
- ✅ Good: 2024-03-15
- ❌ Bad: 3/15/24 or 15 March 2024

**Pro tip:** The app often guesses this correctly from PDF filenames!

### 🏷️ Develop Your Categories
Create a standard list of categories you use:
- Politics, Business, Crime, Sports, Culture, Local, International
- Keep it simple and consistent!

## Common Questions & Quick Fixes

### "The app says my Excel file is invalid"
**Fix:** Check that all 19 column headers are exactly right. Copy and paste from our list above to be sure!

### "My PDF won't open"
**Possible reasons:**
- File is password-protected (remove the password first)
- File is corrupted (try opening it in a PDF reader first)
- File isn't actually a PDF (check the file extension)

### "My formatting disappeared in Excel"
**Fix:** This sometimes happens with solid colored text. Add some **bold** or *italic* to the colored text - that usually fixes it!

### "I can't see all the fields on my screen"
**Fix:** The whole window scrolls! Use your mouse wheel or the scroll bar on the right side.

### "The app is running slowly"
**Solutions:**
- Close other programs to free up memory
- Use smaller PDF files when possible
- Restart the app occasionally during long sessions

## Final Encouragement

Remember, this app is designed to make your life easier, not harder! Don't worry if it takes a few tries to get the hang of it - that's totally normal.

**Experiment:** Try different workflows and see what feels right for your research style.

**Take breaks:** Research can be intense work. The app saves your progress, so feel free to take breaks and come back later.

**Ask for help:** If you get stuck, the built-in tooltips (hover over any button or field) often have helpful hints.
