## CRITICAL - Lost Implementations to Restore

### 1. **Template Management System (v2.4.0) - ✅ COMPLETED**
**Status**: ✅ Successfully re-implemented after git rollback
**Original Achievement**: Full template save/load system for field configurations

**Implemented Features**:
- **Template Infrastructure**: Professional template manager with JSON storage in `%APPDATA%/DJs Timeline Machine/templates/`
- **Template Save Dialog**: 450x350 professional interface with name validation, description, and field preview
- **Template Controls Integration**: Clean toolbar with dropdown, load/save/reset/delete buttons + help button
- **UI Layout Improvements**: Restructured dialog with enhanced header, compact field sections, removed warning clutter
- **Space Optimization**: ~150px vertical space saved through compact layouts and professional design
- **Swedish UI**: Complete Swedish language support throughout template system
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with TemplateManager, TemplateSaveDialog, and enhanced FieldConfigDialog
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive confirmations for destructive operations and template file management

**Implementation Complete**:
- TemplateManager class for JSON template storage/loading ✅
- TemplateSaveDialog with professional 450x350 interface ✅
- Template dropdown integration in field configuration dialog ✅
- Load/Save/Reset/Delete template buttons with Swedish labels ✅
- Template validation (name, description, field preview) ✅
- %APPDATA% directory management for template storage ✅

### 2. **Field Name Uniqueness Validation (v2.4.1) - ✅ COMPLETED**
**Status**: ✅ Successfully re-implemented with robust context-aware validation
**Original Achievement**: Comprehensive real-time validation system with advanced duplicate detection

**Implemented Features**:
- **Real-Time Context-Aware Validation**: Live duplicate checking using current dialog field values
- **Enhanced Validator Architecture**: Context-injection pattern prevents stale validation state
- **Bulletproof Duplicate Detection**: Real-time validation with `get_instant_feedback_with_context()` method
- **Swedish Error Messages**: Professional error display for field name conflicts
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing validation methods preserved alongside new context-aware functionality

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhanced `FieldNameValidator.validate_single_name()` to accept context_names parameter ✅
- Added `RealTimeValidator.get_instant_feedback_with_context()` for live validation ✅
- Updated field configuration dialog to pass current context to validator ✅
- Maintained all existing validation features (length, characters, reserved names) ✅
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback to existing validation if context fails ✅

**Result**: Users now receive immediate visual feedback when entering duplicate field names, preventing configuration errors and ensuring data integrity.

**Root Cause of Loss**: Failed to follow versioning protocol - should have committed v2.4.0 and v2.4.1 before investigating lock button issue. Git rollback during debugging destroyed uncommitted work.

## Current Bugs to Fix

### 1. Excel File Selection Reset Bug ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.3**
**Problem**: When field names are changed in the configuration dialog, the selected Excel file remained selected.
**Solution**: Added Excel file reset logic to `_clear_all_field_data()` method.
**Regression Found & Fixed**: Initial fix caused custom field names to be lost due to stale data overwrite - fixed by removing problematic save_config() call.

### 2. Custom Field Names Not Displaying in UI (v2.3.0) ✅ **FIXED in v2.3.3**
**Problem**: Custom field names are saved correctly but not displayed in the UI after applying changes.

**Root Cause Identified**: `_on_field_config_applied()` method called `clear_config()` which deleted the entire config file immediately after custom names were saved to it.

**Solution Implemented (v2.3.3)**:
- Removed `self.config_manager.clear_config()` from `_on_field_config_applied()` method
- Changed from complete config deletion to selective user data clearing only
- Preserved config file containing custom field names during field configuration reset
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout custom field name data flow

**Result**: Custom field names now persist correctly and display immediately in main UI after Apply.

### 2. Font Size Bug - Händelse Only ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: All font size change buttons only affect Händelse field, not Note1-3 fields.
**Solution**: Font size buttons now correctly change text size in all text fields (Händelse, Note1, Note2, Note3).
**Status**: Fixed - Users can now adjust font size for all note fields.

### 3. Field Hiding Bug - Excel Template Creation ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.1**
**Problem**: Hidden fields marked as "Dölj" were still being included in Excel template creation despite field hiding configuration working correctly elsewhere in application.

**Root Cause Identified**: `gui/dialogs.py:131` was using `get_all_display_names()` instead of `get_visible_display_names()` when creating Excel templates.

**Investigation Process**: Used specialized sub-agents (bug-finder-debugger, architecture-planner, code-reviewer-refactorer) for systematic root cause analysis. Found inconsistency where 9 methods correctly used `get_visible_display_names()` but template creation dialog used `get_all_display_names()`.

**Solution Implemented (v2.5.1)**:
- Changed single line in `gui/dialogs.py:131` from `get_all_display_names()` to `get_visible_display_names()`
- Updated comment to clarify visibility filtering: "Get current field display names (may be custom names) - only visible fields"
- Surgical fix aligns template creation with visibility logic used throughout application

**Result**: Field hiding now works consistently across all Excel operations. Hidden fields are properly excluded from Excel template creation while maintaining all existing functionality.

### 4. Post-v2.5.2 Issues - Next Session Priority
**Context**: These issues were identified after successful completion of the field disabling system (v2.5.2). Field disabling system works correctly but these related issues need attention.

#### 4.1 Excel File Selection Reset Bug ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.3**
**Problem**: When field names are changed in the configuration dialog, the selected Excel file in the main window remains selected but should be reset.
**Solution**: Added Excel file reset logic, then fixed regression by removing stale config save.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.2 Källa1 Field Protection Missing ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.5**
**Problem**: Källa1 (Source1) field name could be changed in the configuration dialog, but shouldn't be editable.
**Solution**: 
- Renamed default field name from "Källa1" to "Källa"
- Made field name non-changeable (protected=True) like Startdatum and Händelse
- Used comprehensive sub-agent analysis for safe implementation
- Maintained full backward compatibility
**Result**: Källa field now appears grayed out in configuration dialog and behaves identically to other system-critical fields.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.3 Font Size Buttons on Note Fields ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.6**
**Problem**: Font size change buttons appear on Note1-3 fields but should be removed.
**Solution**: Added conditional logic in `create_formatting_toolbar()` to only create font size button for Händelse field.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.4 Font Size Button Behavior Inconsistency ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.6**
**Problem**: Font size change button on Händelse field should control font size for ALL text fields (Händelse, Note1, Note2, Note3), not just the Händelse field.
**Root Cause**: Font size method used hardcoded field names instead of dynamic lookup from field manager.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented dynamic field name resolution using `field_manager.get_display_name()`
- Created `get_text_field_display_names()` helper method with fallback handling
- A+ button now correctly affects ALL text fields regardless of field renaming
- Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.5 Field Disabling Persistence Bug ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.7**
**Problem**: Field disabled states not restored after app restart despite being saved correctly to config.
**Root Cause**: Dual manager system where `field_state_manager` was not initialized during app startup.
**Investigation**: Used bug-finder-debugger and architecture-planner sub-agents for systematic analysis.
**Solution**: 
- Added missing `field_state_manager.set_disabled_fields(hidden_fields)` in main_window.py:385
- Synchronized both field_manager and field_state_manager during startup
- Single line fix following proven pattern from field_config_dialog.py
**Result**: Disabled fields now correctly persist and restore their state after app restart.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.6 Field Configuration Dialog UI Issues ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.9**
**Problems Resolved**: Multiple UI issues in field configuration dialog successfully fixed through architectural redesign:
- **Field Width Inconsistency**: All entry fields now have exactly uniform width (250px containers)
- **Grid System Problems**: Implemented fixed-width container architecture for perfect alignment  
- **Visual Consistency**: Protected, required, and editable fields all align perfectly
- **Layout Independence**: Field alignment no longer affected by label length (e.g., "Underkategori")

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Fixed-width container architecture with 5 transparent containers per row
- ✅ Label container (140px), Entry container (250px), Counter (55px), Icon (35px), Checkbox (85px)
- ✅ All entry fields start at exact same horizontal position regardless of field type
- ✅ Used `grid_propagate(False)` to maintain container sizes
- ✅ Spacer frames ensure consistent layout for all field variations

**Technical Achievement**: Complete architectural redesign using container-based grid system
**Result**: Pixel-perfect field alignment achieved - all fields uniform width and position
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.7 Template Dropdown Spurious Entry Bug ✅ **FIXED in v2.5.10**
**Problem**: Non-selectable "templates" entry appearing in template dropdown menu alongside valid templates.
**Root Cause**: Invalid `templates.json` file in templates directory being listed without validation.
**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Enhanced `list_templates()` method with JSON structure validation
- ✅ Added `_validate_loaded_template()` checking for each candidate file
- ✅ Graceful error handling for invalid/corrupted JSON files
- ✅ Renamed invalid file to `templates.json.invalid`
- ✅ Updated app version display from v2.5.8 to v2.5.10
**Result**: Clean dropdown with only valid templates, correct version display
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
